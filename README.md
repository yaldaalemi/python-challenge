# Python Challenge: PyBank and PyPoll

## Project Overview
In this project, I completed two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll, which required the use of Python programming to analyze financial and election data. The goal was to demonstrate proficiency in Python scripting for real-world problem-solving.

## PyBank Challenge
In the PyBank challenge, I analyzed a financial dataset (budget_data.csv) containing two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses." The objectives were as follows:
- Calculated the total number of months in the dataset.
- Calculated the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
- Calculated the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period and the average of those changes.
- Identified the greatest increase in profits (date and amount) and the greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

The results were printed to the terminal and exported to a text file.

## PyPoll Challenge
In the PyPoll challenge, I analyzed election data (election_data.csv) containing three columns: "Voter ID," "County," and "Candidate." The tasks included:
- Calculating the total number of votes cast.
- Creating a list of candidates who received votes.
- Calculating the percentage of votes each candidate won.
- Calculating the total number of votes each candidate won.
- Determining the winner of the election based on popular vote.

The results were printed to the terminal and exported to a text file.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrated my ability to use Python for data analysis, including tasks such as reading CSV files, performing calculations, and generating output. Both challenges were completed successfully, and the Python scripts provided efficient solutions to the given problems.
